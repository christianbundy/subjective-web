    <h1>Ahoy world!</h1>
    <p>
      I'm experimenting with a new format where I'd like to try embedding Git
      repositories from my friends as Git submodules.
    </p>

    <p>Two random notes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Jordan's
        <a
          href="submodules/jordancrane/blog/microposts/2020/07/20/181020/index.html"
          >first micropost</a
        >
        has me on the edge of my seat. I'm very much looking forward to
        micropost number two.
      </li>
      <li>
        I'm super excited to have a
        <a href="submodules/coolguy/www/index.html"
          >local archive of coolguy.website</a
        >, and just hit up Zach to see if there's a repo for his latest version.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      I'm kinda impressed at how Jordan does a subtree push so that I don't have
      to run <code>hugo</code> locally. I've been thinking about whether I'd
      like to publish source (probably Markdown) or not (probably HTML) to my
      Git repo, and it seems like maybe <em>two</em> repos solves this problem
      rather well.
    </p>

    <p>
      In other news, I've recently become very appreciative that I never got
      that silly <code>&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;</code> tattoos that were
      popular a few years ago. I wonder how many people got them.
